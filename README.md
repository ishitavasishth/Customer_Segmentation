As part of our Marketing Analytics course, my group analyzed customer behavior using K-means clustering and RFM metrics. We identified key segments and performed CLV analysis to assess customer value. Insights from regression modeling helped us develop targeted strategies to optimize campaigns, boost engagement, and drive revenue growth. This presentation showcases data-driven recommendations to enhance customer loyalty and maximize high-value segment contributions.
